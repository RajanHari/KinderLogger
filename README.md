# KinderLogger
An AI Assistant with RAG and FastAPI



KinderLogger is an AI-powered assistant designed to help parents stay informed about their childâ€™s daily school activities. The system allows teachers to record audio updates about students, which are then processed, moderated, and stored in a searchable format. Parents can interact with the system by asking questions, and the AI retrieves relevant information from the stored updates.
